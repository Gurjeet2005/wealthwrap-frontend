# wealthwrap-frontend
WealthWrap is a modular frontend financial management web application designed to help users interact with financial planning features through a clean, responsive, and structured interface. The project follows a scalable architecture with separate modules for authentication, UI handling, storage management, API interaction, and financial simulation. It includes multiple pages such as login, registration, dashboard, profile, and simulator, providing an organized multi-page application experience. The styling system is built using reusable CSS layers, and the JavaScript code is structured into focused modules to ensure maintainability and readability. The project demonstrates best practices in frontend development, including modular design, responsive layout implementation, and clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend and maintain.
